# CircleCI VoiceOver

An example CircleCI configuration file to use for VoiceOver testing with Guidepup.

Copy this `config.yml` into your own project's `.circleci` directory, modifying the `steps` to include your project specific setup and execution.

See <https://github.com/cmorten/circleci-voiceover-poc> for a full implementation example.
